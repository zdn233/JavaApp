Vector Drawing Program - Dainan Zhang

The program is written in Mac OS.

Additional Features: choose number2:
There's a Button under the color chooser called Multi-select Click the button and click on the shapes that you want to choose, there's a new rectangle shown on the canvas in terms of visualization. The rectangle will contain all the shapes that are chosen.

If you already select multiple shapes and you want to select a new group of shapes, just click the "multi-select" button again and you can start choose a new group of shapes.

To drag all these shapes, click on any inner point inside that aid rectangle and drag it
on the screen, all the shapes will then be dragged together as a unit.

For resize, click on the Top left corner of the rectangle to resize these shapes.

You cannot use the color chooser after you clicked on the "Eraser" button, there will be a pop up message indicating this error.

For OTHER features, it behaves the same as the assignment's requirements.

By default, the initial state of the canvas is to draw a "Rectangle" using "Blue" color and "Thin" line thickness.

For each tool, you have to click the "Tool" first and then apply other actions or "Tools". If the order is wrong, the behavior of the canvas is "Undefined".
